## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## My Experience

This project was a lot of trial and error for me and I've spent most of the time reading up documentation. I've implemented a lot of features which later I scrapped (like javascript mediaqueries, to optimise scrolling on button click in the nav when viewed on mobile) and I've experimented around with performance taxation when using different functions and methods. Overall an enjoyable intro to the DOM manipulation.
