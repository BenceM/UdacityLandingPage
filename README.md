# Javascript On Landing page

This is a forked landing page project, extended with some styling and javascript. JS is mainly focused on DOM manipulation.

## What Was Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- FontAwesome

## What Happens

- Navigation is built dynamically, based on the sections present in the html.
- Page top button, appears when scrolling up and takes you to the top of the page.
- Active state for sections and navigation and specific css for them.
- Standard scroll for menu links is prevented and smooth scroll is added.

## My Experience

This project was a lot of trial and error for me and I've spent most of the time reading up documentation. I've implemented a lot of features which later I scrapped (like javascript mediaqueries, to optimise scrolling on button click in the nav when viewed on mobile) and I've experimented around with performance taxation when using different functions and methods. Overall an enjoyable intro to the DOM manipulation.
